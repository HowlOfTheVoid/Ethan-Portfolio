            Hi, I'm Ethan Graupmann! <img src="html_finalprojimages/waving-hand.png" width="60px"/>
          </h1>
          <p>
            I am an entry-level software developer looking to begin his experience in a professional environment.
            I got my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from the University of Denver, and have been pursuing my IBM Certification in Full-Stack Development over the past month!
            My pride in work comes from my ability to approach a problem with a creative solution, thinking outside the box to come up with ideas that are new and innovative, and broaden the horizons of possibility, even if they are not entirely efficient yet- As exploring the possibilities themselves allow me to then cut down on efficiency after.

          Ethan is a quick learner and a very capable developer, adapting quickly to meet deadlines and create new ideas.
          His positive, can-do attitude is an inspiration and does not overstate his capabilities.

        <div class="recommendation">
          <span>&#8220;</span>
          Though I've only known him as a lifeguard, Ethan is always dedicated to helping out and giving his all in his work.
          He's a knowledgeable programmer, and knows his way around computers better than anyone else I've worked with.

          <span>&#8220;</span>
          I've done game programming alongside Ethan, and found him to be a great idea-maker, as well as a great help when it comes to code.
          He has a passion for game and software development, and would be a valuable asset anywhere.
